This is a Flutter cross-platform application specially designed for smartwatches on WearOS and WatchOS. Currently, as the sole maintainer of this project, I am openly inviting contributions from developers like you to help improve and expand the project and its features.

## About the Idea

The idea is simple yet effective: the application prompts users to set specific intervals, for example, 20 minutes. If the smartwatch's accelerometer does not detect any significant movements such as standing up or jumping during these intervals, then the smartwatch will vibrate. This simple nudge will encourage the user to stay active, promoting healthier habits.

What distinguishes this idea is its self-sufficient nature; the user doesn't have to continually reset timers or manually monitor their movements. All these aspects are meticulously managed by the application.

The concept utilizes Flutter's cross-platform development power to create a tool that can potentially alter user habits and encourage a healthier lifestyle.

While everybody is encouraged to submit pull requests, it is suggested that you first:
